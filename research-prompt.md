Research Prompt for AI Agent: Image Compression Using Row and Column Statistics with CUDA Reconstruction
Objective
Investigate the core concept and methodology of our ongoing project on image compression, which involves reducing a grayscale image to arrays of row sums, column sums, row sums of squares, and column sums of squares, followed by reconstructing the image using CUDA-accelerated iterative scaling. The goal is to understand the approach, evaluate its effectiveness, identify limitations, and propose enhancements or alternative methods for practical image compression.
Background
The project focuses on a novel image compression technique for grayscale images (with pixel intensities as integers [0, 255]). The method compresses an ( M \times N ) image by computing:

Row Sums: (\sum_{j} x_{i,j}) for each row (i).
Column Sums: (\sum_{i} x_{i,j}) for each column (j).
Row Sums of Squares: (\sum_{j} x_{i,j}^2) for each row (i).
Column Sums of Squares: (\sum_{i} x_{i,j}^2) for each column (j).

These four arrays (of sizes ( M ), ( N ), ( M ), and ( N )) represent the compressed form. Reconstruction is performed using CUDA kernels that iteratively scale a matrix to match these target arrays, with a final rounding step to ensure integer outputs in [0, 255]. The approach has been tested on 4x4 and 6x6 matrices, with verification to check if the reconstructed matrix satisfies the target sums.
Core Concept
The core idea is to achieve high compression ratios by storing only marginal statistics (sums and sums of squares) instead of the full pixel array, leveraging GPU parallelism for fast reconstruction. For a 2000x2000 image, the original size is 4,000,000 bytes (8-bit pixels), while the compressed size is approximately 16,000 bytes (4 arrays of 2000 floats), yielding a potential compression ratio of 250:1 for grayscale images. The reconstruction aims to approximate the original image by satisfying the statistical constraints, though non-uniqueness of solutions poses a challenge.
Tasks for the AI Agent

Analyze Existing Code and Methodology:

Review all local CUDA code files (e.g., matrix_reconstruction_with_verification.cu, sum_squares_reconstruction_int.cu, etc.) to understand the implementation.
Summarize the workflow: input matrix processing, computation of the four arrays, iterative scaling, rounding to [0, 255], and verification.
Identify the CUDA kernels used (e.g., compute_row_stats, scale_rows, round_to_int) and their roles in parallelizing computations.


Evaluate Effectiveness:

Assess the compression ratio achieved for 4x4 and 6x6 matrices in the code. Calculate theoretical ratios for larger images (e.g., 2000x2000).
Test the reconstruction accuracy by comparing the reconstructed matrix to the input matrix in provided examples (e.g., 6x6 matrix with values like {10, 20, ..., 125}).
Check verification results to determine how often the reconstructed matrix satisfies all four constraints within the specified tolerance (1%).


Identify Limitations:

Investigate why the reconstructed matrix may not exactly match the input matrix. Consider the non-uniqueness problem (multiple matrices satisfying the same sums).
Analyze the impact of rounding to [0, 255] on reconstruction accuracy.
Evaluate the computational cost of 100 iterations in CUDA for larger matrices (e.g., scalability to 2000x2000).


Propose Improvements:

Suggest additional constraints (e.g., higher-order moments like (\sum x^3), or pixel value histograms) to reduce solution ambiguity and improve reconstruction fidelity.
Explore optimization techniques for the iterative scaling algorithm, such as adaptive iteration counts or convergence criteria.
Recommend CUDA optimizations (e.g., reducing shared memory usage, minimizing atomic operations) to enhance performance for large images.


Explore Alternatives:

Compare the sum-based method to standard image compression techniques (e.g., JPEG using Discrete Cosine Transform, PNG). Analyze trade-offs in compression ratio, reconstruction quality, and computational cost.
Investigate compressed sensing or discrete tomography as potential frameworks for similar problems, referencing concepts from provided links (e.g., Discrete Tomography).
Propose a hybrid approach combining sum-based statistics with transform-based methods for better practicality.


Extend to Color Images:

Outline how to extend the method to RGB images, considering separate arrays for red, green, and blue channels (e.g., 2000x6 arrays for a 2000x2000 image).
Estimate the compression ratio and reconstruction challenges for color images.
